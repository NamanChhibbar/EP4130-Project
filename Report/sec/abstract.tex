    We developed a dataset for classifying galaxy images into four categories: spiral, elliptical, irregular, and invalid. Using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we automated galaxy classification. Our goal is to understand galaxy properties, such as star formation, using advanced ML and DL methods applied directly to the images.
